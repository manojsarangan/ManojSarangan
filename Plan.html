<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong>Manoj Sarangan<br>
<strong>Login:</strong> jc465460</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The CossiePlay website is intended to improve the business of CossiePlay and to be more successful by increasing the number of customers and appealing to a younger audience.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The number of customers arriving at CossiePlay and the number of high school kids and young adults cosplaying will be counted and compared to the number of people who had arrived before three months.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>We get cosplayers of all ages, but mostly they are 35 â€“ 50. We want the site to appeal to a younger audience than this, getting high school kids and young adults cosplaying.
